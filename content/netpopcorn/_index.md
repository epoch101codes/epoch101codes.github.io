# NetPopcorn

Some OS subsystems may suffer performance scalability more than others. This is the case, for example, with the Linux network stack. With increasingly fast network cards, any network stack cross-CPU synchronization may hinder packet processing latency â€“ fundamental in the data-center (cf. tail latency) or in telecommunication and network appliances. NetPopcorn extends the replicated-kernel OS model of Popcorn Linux with a distributed network stack implementation and a distributed device driver model (Snap Bean). NetPopcorn shows better performance than Linux and state-of-the-art research efforts on Linux, as well as nearing the same performance as kernel-bypass solutions (cf. DPDK).
