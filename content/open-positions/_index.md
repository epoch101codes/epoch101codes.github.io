# Open Positions

Two postdoctoral positions are available in the [Systems Software Research Group](https://ssrg.ece.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech's ECE Department](https://ece.vt.edu) on projects involving scalable multicore operating systems and multicore virtualization with quality of service guarantees. Recent computer science or computer engineering PhD graduates with background in operating systems, virtualization, dependability, and distributed systems are sought for both positions. Strong programming expertise with the Linux kernel and/or Linux-based hypervisors such as KVM and Xen is required.

Both positions are for two-year minimum, with strong possibilities for additional years, and have no teaching obligations. Contact Prof. Binoy Ravindran (binoy@vt.edu) with a CV or for any questions.
